Hi, I’m Stanislav Golovin — Senior Python Engineer.

I design and scale backend systems for LLM-powered products, with a focus on RAG pipelines, async architectures, and high-load APIs.

Currently working on an AI assistant platform: building retrieval and evaluation pipelines, improving LLM answer quality, and scaling FastAPI services in production. I care about clear architecture, performance, reliability, and long-term maintainability.

**Expertise**:
 LLM & RAG systems (LangChain, LangSmith, evaluation & regression)
 Async backend & APIs (FastAPI, asyncio, aiohttp)
 Microservices, integrations, event-driven systems
 Data & infrastructure (MongoDB, ClickHouse, Kafka, Docker, CI/CD)
 API design, documentation, and engineering best practices

I enjoy solving complex problems at the system level and working in teams with strong engineering culture.
